To build OpenAL-Soft

# mkdir build
# cd build
# Set up vc++ environment vars:  C:\"Program Files"\"Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0"\VC\vcvarsall.bat
# cmake -DUTILS=0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
#* Change that last variable in the above line from 'Release' to 'Debug' if you need a debug build
# replace all /MD with /MT in the build/ directory (this is so you don't need the vb runtime libs)
# nmake
# done!
